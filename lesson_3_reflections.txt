When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

When I am working on the same projects from multiple devices/computers but also when I work on a project together collaboratively with other people.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Because I'd like to be able to choose whether a project revision (or which project revision) gets pulled or not pulled.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

- Forks are created when I want to copy a project from an existing online git link to my own repository and make changes there without affecting the origin.
- Clones are created when I want to copy locally a project that exists in my repository
- A new branch is created when I want to work on a new project's feature or experiment. If experiment/feature is successful, I can then merge it with its master branch.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

Benefit is that you can work while being offline on different variations of the project that are made by various people on your remote repository. Then you can decide which changes to commit and which ones not.
